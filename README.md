# pygame_experiment

Just an attempt to create something with pygame. Nothing too fancy. This attempt
will create a Zelda: Link to the Past type clone. This means we'll need
backgrounds, sprites, asset management, hit boxes, etc.

# Installation

This was made using Python 3.9.1 and pygame 2.0.1 (see the requirements.txt for
more). This assumes you know how to install python. If you don't, I recommend
[asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/#/). However, that might not be available to Windows
users.

- First create an virtual env however you prefer, e.g. `python3 -m venv .env`
- Install the requirements, `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the app, `python game.py`

__To Exit the game press the ESC key__

# Tests

There aren't any yet. Need to figure out how to move a box around the screen
first.
